/*
 * Typography plugin styles are applied by Tailwind CLI, not Bun's bundler.
 * Run: bunx @tailwindcss/cli -i frontend/styles.css -o dist/index.css
 *
 * @source "../dist" tells Tailwind v4 to scan the dist/ directory for utility
 * classes. Without it, Tailwind only scans relative to this file (frontend/)
 * and misses all classes in the generated HTML.
 *
 * The `prose` class from @tailwindcss/typography handles all article formatting:
 * headings, paragraphs, lists, code blocks, blockquotes, links, etc.
