# Vision

  When you fork this repo and start building, replace this with what 
  you're building and why. Spark can help you write it, or fill it in 
  yourself anytime.

  Keep it brief: 3-5 sentences. What the project does, who it's for, 
  where it's heading. Every agent that works in this codebase reads 
  this first to understand the purpose behind the features they build.

  Example:
  
  Tidepool is a real-time ocean monitoring dashboard for marine 
  biologists. It ingests sensor data from buoy networks, detects 
  anomalies in temperature and salinity, and surfaces alerts when 
  conditions threaten coral reef ecosystems.
  
  The goal is a single pane of glass that replaces the spreadsheet 
  workflows most research stations use today.
