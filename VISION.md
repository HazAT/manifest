# Vision

Manifest is a TypeScript/Bun framework designed to be read, understood, and modified by AI agents. Every line of code — framework, features, schemas, services — is written as source you own and can change, not as a dependency you consume.

The goal: a codebase where an agent can drop in cold, read the code, and build correctly without tribal knowledge. No hidden behavior, no magic conventions, no framework black boxes. Explicit, self-describing, and completely transparent.

This repository is the blueprint. It ships as a fork — every project built with Manifest starts here and evolves into its own thing.
